      <h1>My Dearest palak,</h1>
      <p>
        got something to get off my chest, so here goes. I've been into you for
        a while now, not sure when it started. Maybe when you saved me from a
        bad path, or when we started understanding each other better. I feel at
        ease with you, just like with Jot. I'm usually pretty insecure, but with
        you, it's different.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you, yaar, truly, deeply. I'm not confessing right now, I'll wait
        till we finish high school. I don't know if you feel the same, but I
        hope you do. I didn't want to risk our friendship, that's why I kept
        quiet. Will you be my Girlfriend?
      </p>

      <p>
        I've been keeping my feelings from you for a while, but if I find the courage,
        I'll email this to you whenever I propose to you. You mean so lot to me, 
        and I've never felt this much comfortable with anyone as i do with you in my 
        life. I adore you so much. If this upsets you, please forgive me.ü•π‚ù§Ô∏è
